                            Instafind is a mobile application, designed for people who have trouble to find their cars in big and crowded parking lot. The device is powered by electricity on the cars or can be powered by bikes' wheels.

                    <p class="lead">
                        We spent 3 weeks on user research and analysis in total. For this project, we included two sessions of pre-design user research, which contains 5 sessions of interview. We generated personas out of the data we collected during interview sessions.

                  <strong>Data analysis</strong> of the result of our user research was not too complicated. Since we collected qualitative data, we analyzed the data by summarizing information that are useful for our personas. We tried to make our participants as diverse as possible, and we ended up having 3 college students, 1 professor and 1 full-time mom as our interviees. I think the data might even be more applicable on other aspects if we had more time and collect data from a even more diverse background of participants.

                <p>
                  The team then gathered together to analysis the personas. From the personas, we realized the device should not only be used on cars, but also bikes as well. One of the college students told us his experience of unable to find his bike on a big campus. We decided to design the device being powered not only by electricity but also power generated from bikes' wheels as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also took the availability of the device in consideration. In some underground parking lot, internet might not always be available, so we decided to include bluetooth in the device as well. Although bluetooth has range and distance limitation, it is available while internet is out of the options.

                        After fully analyzing our data, we started our brainstorm process, mainly focusing on the three different problems and solutions. We spent 5 minutes on writing down all the ideas we have, one idea at one post-it. <br>After this five minutes of rapid brainstorm, we then sticked all the post-its on a white board and started picking out promising ideas and started another session of 5 minutes brainstorm on these ideas. We iterated this process for 5 times, which led to a promising and structured information architecture that we will going to utilize on the product.

                      As the lead designer, I led the other two designers together on sketching out the user experience interaction flow. We decided the information architecture at the same time as we figured out the interaction work flow.

                    Below is the simplified main user interface. I let the interfaces being as simple as possible. For the purpose of directing, though map is the key element, directing, or following the directions, are even more important. Key user experience design element here is to ensure that it is easy to follow the map.

                    We decided that easiest way to follow the map is combining virtual reality into the product. As in following real time arrows is easier to read the maps. However, VR might not always be available, since internet or some smartphones just simply do not support VR, we also added the feature of switching back to following the traditional maps.
