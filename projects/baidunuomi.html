                        I was working for a company called Baidu.Inc, and I was working at their headquarter, located at Beijing, China. Baidu is a really big company. While Google and all of Google’s products, including Google Search Engine, Google Maps, Google Docs, YouTube, etc. are all banned in China, Baidu is basically the Chinese version of Google. Baidu is the biggest Chinese Search Engine in the whole world, and it is also the biggest, most used web application by people in China. Baidu is founded at 2000 January by Robin Li, and its products have taken most of the software application market in China as well. It is committed to providing people with "simple and reliable" access to information. Baidu also insists on believing in the power of technology, and simple and reliable culture and talent development mechanism as the most valuable asset. Baidu now has numerous offices around the whole world, such as California, Tokyo, Shanghai, and more. I believe I am really lucky to conduct my internship at the headquarter in Beijing, and have definitely learned so much. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Besides search engine, Baidu also possesses a lot of other products as well, such as Baidu Photo, Baidu Clouds, Baidu Mobile, Baidu Promo, Phoenix System, Baidu Video, Baidu Translate, and so much more. Baidu has numerous products in great number of fields in the market that involve with e-commerce, advertisements, Clouds with file-share and such. Besides the product that is most well known, Baidu Search Engine, Baidu serves a tons of these different applications and services.

                        I was involved in different types of projects, including user interface design, data processing, data analysis and data visualisation, with some translation and presentation. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        User Interface Design is one of my most important work here. Considering Baidu Nuomi is a big and new product of Baidu, my work often are taken places in so many different areas, which is why even though my title is UX Intern, my job is so much more than simply UX design. I work with other designers on our UI design projects. The UI design projects that I was involved in are icon design, logo design, landing page design and information architecture design. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Icon design and logo design are both visual design. These two are graphic designs with a lot of reiterations. When I got to the company, the program manager told us that our boss is expecting some new icons and logos for Nuomi that match the icon of Baidu. Nuomi was originally an individual iOS software application that basically serves information of groupons on restaurants. After Baidu purchased this product, Baidu decided to develop it into an application that provides information about groupons and deals in many different fields. Besides just restaurants, it is now a geo-tagged app that also serves areas like hotel, wedding, movies, and more. The logo of Nuomi does not remind people of Baidu at all, so our boss decided to use a different logo that matches the visual design of others of Baidu’s products. This visual design process takes very long. Me and my teammates design one, and receive feedbacks and critiques, and redesign one, then receive more feedbacks and critiques. Basically, this process was already started when I joined the team, and did not finish when I left.   
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The web landing page design is not so easy either. One thing that made my work so much harder than it as is that the information architecture was constantly changing. I was not involved in the process of deciding what information to be included on the landing page, and we did always receive tons of new information to be included. One example is the banner. Banner was used to include more promotions and advertisement to show users, improving these ads’ exposing. However, the user research team submit all different result of their research from time to time, so whether the banner should be contained on the page or not, and what information to be included on the banner are the two questions that were discussed the most and never reached a conclusion.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Working for big company has its benefits and weakness. One of the benefits is that this company is really resourceful, which are represents in many different aspects. Two aspects that made my life so much easier are my smart colleagues and large investment we are receiving. Baidu is very big, influential and wealthy. In the past three years, Baidu Nuomi has received more than 2 billions CNY worths of investment. With all these money, Nuomi has provided us so many useful resources, one of them is smart colleagues. My colleagues are all either really smart, sophisticated or really highly educated from best institutes. Working with them definitely taught me so much in work fields. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Even though working for Baidu made me realise all its benefits, there certainly exists weakness as well. One weakness I found in the product Nuomi is chaos from time to time. Maybe its because this company is too big, but from the very first stage of working here, I noticed how chaotic this place can be. For example, the projects I worked . I understand maybe in small companies for even startup, working in many different fields are certainly required, but I definitely did not expect this to happen in such a big company like Baidu.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        First, I finally understand how user interface design and user experience design are so different while working. While taking classes at school, I was always a little confused of what is the different between User Interface Design and User Experience Design. I thought UI design is only part of UX designers’ job. However, after working for Baidu for a whole summer, I finally understand that they actually have quite different job responsibilities, especially in big companies. UX design, as in user experience design, are actually responsible for various aspects, instead of simply software application design like I understood from coursework. In Baidu, there are so many UX designers. While a lot of them are working on application product design, there are also a large number of them who are working on brand design, advertisement-promotion design, even big projects like subway experience design. Most of UX designers at Baidu have experiences working in other fields. Some of them were software developing engineers before transferred to UX team, some of them were interaction designer on other products, and a lot of them are from architecture design. Same thing happened in UI design team. However, UI design team are more focused on visual design. Although a lot of people who are at UI design team knows some basic coding skills, UI designers are mostly from visual design field, industrial field, etc. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Secondly, I also learned how user experience designers interact with products in professional field. Before entered the major, like most people, even though I knew user experience design is different from software develop engineering, I did not quite being sure about what and where exactly is the position of user experience designers, and how user experience designers interact with developers and products. After starting my internship, I understood how human centered design and engineering is an engineering major, and how user experience design is also a type of engineering, because, just like software developing engineers, user experience designers are devoting their time and energy building out the most amazing product as they can. Even though the exact job responsibilities of software developing engineers and user experience designers are quite different, both of these two title of people are working so tightly and are around the product. What they both do is trying the best to build a great product, which is why they work so closely together.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The third thing I learned is how to deal with a large set of data, including processing them, analysis and visualisation. Again, like I mentioned earlier, Nuomi is a relatively new and yet influential and big product. We have so much data everyday to process and analysis in the daily report, and we also have so much data visualisation to be included in the report. Everyday I would log into our inner employers web and download the data, such as the amount new users, re-purchasing rate in 7, 14, 30 days etc., from the day before, using SQL programming language. Then I need to process and analyse these data by move them to a new daily report file and visualise them in Excel. This whole process takes almost all morning, so it is definitely a big part of my job.
